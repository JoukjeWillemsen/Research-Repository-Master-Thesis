**Permission and storage**

Besides simulated control groups, the PRO-ACT database has been included to function as "historical controls". Furthermore, the input parameters used in the simulation study are based on the estimated parameters of the PRO-ACT database.

I have been granted permission by the NCRI team to download data from the PRO-ACT database. After registration, the PRO-ACT dataset can be downloaded [here](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Data/Index/1). 

The use of the PRO-ACT dataset in this simulationstudy is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of Utrecht University, filed under number 19-125. A copy of the approval form can be found in folder 'B.Privacy & datamanagement'.

According to the [website](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Document/DisplayLatest/5) of the PRO-ACT database *"The non-profit organization, Prize4Life, created the PRO-ACT database in partnership with the Northeast ALS Consortium and the Neurological Clinical Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital, and with funding from the ALS Therapy Alliance. PRO-ACT was created to provide anyone interested in moving ALS research forward quickly with a powerful tool, thus furthering our shared mission of accelerating the discovery of treatments and a cure for ALS."*. 

The use of the PRO-ACT dataset in this study is conform the [terms and conditions of the PRO-ACT database](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Document/DisplayLatest/1).

Statement four of the terms and conditions of using the PRO-ACT dataset states that the PRO-ACT Database should not be shared with anyone who has not signed the agreement and acknowledged the terms and conditions. Hence only summarystatistics are stored in this research archive and no raw data that contain parts of the PRO-ACT dataset in any way are shared online. Therefore, the files `DATA2018` and `0.Historicaldata` - needed to replicate the simulationstudy - are not part of this research archive, as they contain (a part of) the PRO-ACT dataset. However, after registration, the PRO-ACT dataset can be downloaded [from their website](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Data/Index/1) to fully replicate the simulationstudy.

For more information about the collection of the data and how privacy is guaranteed we would like to refer to the [PRO-ACT website](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Document/DisplayLatest/9) and [the article of Atassi et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298304)

The data will be stored for a minimal duration of ten years. A copy of this repository has been stored in the archives of Utrecht University.
