**Datamanagment, privacy & ethical approval**

The parameters used to simulate the current controls were based on the PRO-ACT dataset. Furthermore, the data from the controlgroups in the PRO-ACT dataset was used to represent historical controls. 
After registration, the PRO-ACT dataset can be downloaded [here](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Data/Index/1).

*Ethical approval*
I have been granted permission by the NCRI team to download data from the PRO-ACT database.
The use of the PRO-ACT dataset in this simulationstudy is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of Utrecht
University.

*Privacy*
On the website of [PRO-ACT](https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT/Document/DisplayLatest/2#anchor_0), there's the following ethical statement:
"In all of the trials that generated the data included in this database, study protocols were approved by the participating medicalcenters and all participating patients gave informed consent. De-identified data from these trials were donated to the PRO-ACT database for research purposes only and under the explicit conditions that Prize4Life and all users of the data would maintain the anonymity of subjects and not attempt to discover the identity of any subject. In the rare cases where donated data was not already completely anonymized, donated data was further anonymized following the HIPAA de-identification conventions for personal health information: any potential patient initials and/or dates of birth were removed, new randomized subject numbers were created, and wherever possible, trial-specific information was removed in the merging of datasets, including trial center identity and location, trial dates, or other identifying information."

*Data management*
Among the terms and conditions of using the PRO-ACT dataset is the following:

- "I will not share access to the PRO-ACT Database with anyone who has not signed this agreement and acknowledged the terms and conditions set forth herein."

Hence only summarystatistics are stored in this research archive and no datasets that contain parts of the PRO-ACT dataset in any way are shared online.
The Rcode used to simulate historical controls, to obtain the decision qualities of different pooling methods and to obtain the figures presented in the paper are shared on github.
